    <AboutSection title="Background">
      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 col-span-4">
        I’m a Software Engineer with 8+ years of experience building
        high-quality, scalable web applications, with a deep specialization in
        frontend development using React, Next.js, and TypeScript.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 col-span-4">
        I’ve worked across full-stack roles, but my strongest expertise lies in
        modern JavaScript-based frontend architectures, including design systems
        with Storybook, accessibility, unit and E2E testing, and performance
        optimization. I enjoy creating maintainable UI systems that scale across
        large teams and products.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 col-span-4">
        Throughout my career, I’ve collaborated with companies such as Wizeline,
        HumanAPI, Cerby Inc, Upnify, and PriceTravel Holding, as well as working
        as an independent contractor for consulting firms.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 col-span-4">
        I’m a Telematics Engineer graduate with a strong background in
        competitive programming as both a contestant and mentor since 2010, and
        I’ve also served as a tutor for the Mexican Olympiad in Informatics
        (Quintana Roo) — a role that reflects my passion for teaching and
        technical excellence.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 col-span-4">
        I’m driven by continuous learning, clean architecture, and building
        products that deliver real business and user impact.
